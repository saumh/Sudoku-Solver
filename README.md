# Sudoku-Solver
A Java implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking recursion.
Includes a modular architecture with separate components for the board, solver, input/output utilities, and validation.

## Features
- Solve standard 9Ã—9 Sudoku puzzles using backtracking
- Board validation (ensures solution correctness)
- Pretty-printed console output (with row/column separators)
- Modular design (model, solver, io, util packages)
- Easily extendable (adding file-based puzzles, GUI, or new solving strategies)
- JUnit test support (for solver and validation)
